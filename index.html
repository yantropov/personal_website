          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>Hey there, thanks for stopping by. My name is Yury, I live in Melbourne however I originally come from Moscow, Russia. I also spent some time living in Vietnam which resulted in me picking up 3 languages in the process.</p>
          <p>I completed Year 12 back in 2010, since then I've worked mostly in the Logistics and Transport industry in various roles. I am currently undertaking 2 introductory at RMIT. My goal is to continue my formal education by completing a Bachelor of Information Technology. I also hope to gain employment during or after graduating in the field of web development.</p>
          <p>As for hobbies, I used to spend a lot of time riding motorbikes. I like working out in my gym and keeping healthy overall. I like being outdoors whether it is just a simple walk or driving out for camping. Having said that you could also find me spending a lot of time indoors playing games, browsing the web and learning how to code.</p>

            <h1>Interests in I.T</h1>

            <p>I am interested in IT due to its disruptive nature and how it has significantly altered many aspects of our lives. I have witnessed how the way we work, study, commute and socialize, to name a few, are becoming increasingly convenient and efficient. </p>
            <p>In 2017 I took a career break and went back to Russia.  I spent a year working in the sales department for a cloud backup company there and got to know different aspects of the IT profession.  I spoke to developers there and had an opportunity to see what their average day is like as well as their duties and tasks. After that experience I decided to switch my careers.</p>
            <p>In my spare time I taught myself web development and fundamentals of Object-oriented programming. I completed a couple of courses on HTML and CSS. I am also currently undertaking an online Javascript course. I find it fascinating adding interactivity to my websites, giving its visitors a complete new experience and feel. I still have a long journey ahead of me as I continue to hone my web development skills.</p>
            <p>By committing to a technology profession I am hoping to take part in this transformation, position myself well in the job market and give me more flexibility whether itâ€™s work hours or location.</p>

            <h1>Why RMIT</h1>
            <p>I chose to study at RMIT because it offers a flexible online curriculum. As a mature student I am able to study while keeping up with my other commitments such as work.I found my subjects very useful so far, I have learned a lot in the past few weeks. This includes coding using Java and topics related to ethics, working in a team and how to do better presentations.</p>
            <p>I expect to continue to gain more knowledge about Java and object oriented programming. I am also looking forward to expanding my knowledge about databases next year when I take the Database concepts unit, code: RMI-CPT140-2020.</p>

            </div>

            <h1>Ideal Job</h1>
            <p>My ideal job is to become a full stack web developer. However I do understand I will need to first gain experience as a front-end web developer first, then transition to back end and only then apply for positions that seek a professional that has experience in both front and back ends.However I would first need to work towards getting a junior position in front-end web development.</p>
            <p>A Junior front-end developer requires skills in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am planning to acquire these skills by learning on the web through resources such as Udemy, Scrimba and Youtube. To further solidify my skills, I am planning to take Web programming and further web programming via RMIT that are part of the Bachelors of Information Technology. For the back-end I am planning to take the Web development technologies unit via RMIT as well. This unit covers C# and architectural understanding of ASP.NET</p>
